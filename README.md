# Tokenized Healthcare Equipment Maintenance

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based solution for managing the lifecycle maintenance of healthcare equipment. By leveraging smart contracts and tokenization, the system provides transparent, verifiable records of medical device maintenance activities, ensuring patient safety, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency for healthcare facilities.

## Key Components

### Device Registration Contract
- Records detailed information about medical equipment assets
- Stores device specifications, manufacturer details, and warranty information
- Creates unique digital identifiers for each registered device
- Maintains complete ownership and location history
- Tracks device certifications and operational status
- Links devices to their maintenance requirements and history

### Maintenance Scheduling Contract
- Manages regular service requirements and preventative maintenance
- Implements programmable maintenance schedules based on manufacturer specifications
- Automates service notifications and escalation procedures
- Tracks maintenance due dates and overdue services
- Coordinates emergency repair requests
- Maintains service interval compliance records

### Technician Verification Contract
- Validates qualified service providers and maintenance personnel
- Stores technician credentials, certifications, and specializations
- Tracks technician training and qualification history
- Implements reputation systems based on service quality
- Manages authorization levels for different equipment types
- Ensures proper certification for specialized equipment service

### Compliance Tracking Contract
- Ensures adherence to regulatory standards and requirements
- Maintains immutable records of maintenance activities for audit purposes
- Generates compliance reports for regulatory submissions
- Tracks calibration status and testing results
- Implements alerting systems for compliance violations
- Stores digital signatures for completed maintenance procedures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Truffle or Hardhat development framework
- Web3 wallet for transaction signing
- IPFS for decentralized document storage (optional)
- Access to Ethereum network (testnet or private network)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tokenized-healthcare-maintenance.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd tokenized-healthcare-maintenance

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx truffle compile

# Run tests
npx truffle test

# Deploy to test network
npx truffle migrate --network goerli
```

## Usage

The platform serves multiple stakeholders in the healthcare equipment ecosystem:

### For Healthcare Facilities
- Register and manage medical device inventory
- Schedule and monitor maintenance activities
- Verify technician qualifications and service history
- Generate compliance reports for regulatory audits
- Receive alerts for upcoming and overdue maintenance

### For Service Providers
- Verify and maintain technical credentials
- Access assigned maintenance tasks and equipment details
- Document completed service activities with digital proof
- Build verifiable service history and reputation
- Streamline billing and payment processes

### For Regulatory Bodies
- Access immutable maintenance records for auditing
- Verify compliance with maintenance requirements
- Monitor healthcare facility adherence to standards
- Track service provider qualifications and performance

### For Equipment Manufacturers
- Provide digital maintenance specifications and requirements
- Track service history across their installed device base
- Identify recurring issues through maintenance data
- Verify warranty service compliance

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access controls for sensitive device information
- Multi-factor authentication for maintenance approvals
- Encrypted storage of proprietary service procedures
- Regular security audits of smart contracts
- HIPAA compliance for any patient-related data
